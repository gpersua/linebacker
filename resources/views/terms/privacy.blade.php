        <div class="content">
            PrivacyProtector.org, Inc. (“PrivacyProtector.org” “We”, “Us”) is sensitive to your concerns about how we
            use the personal information we collect from you through PrivacyProtector.org's website (the "Site") and
            other plug-ins exchanging information with PrivacyProtector.org ("Applications"). (The Site and Applications
            are sometimes collectively referred to as "Online Services" for simplicity.) PrivacyProtector.org takes your
            privacy seriously, and has implemented this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") and internal policies and
            practices to keep your personal and financial information secure. The Privacy Policy covers
            PrivacyProtector.org's treatment of the Personally Identifiable Information we collect when you use the
            Online Services. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal
            information and how you can access and update this information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our
            Terms of Use and Terms of Service, and therefore governs your use of the Online Services. By using
            PrivacyProtector.org Online Services, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or
            concerns about the Privacy Policy, please contact Customer Care at customercare@PrivacyProtector.org.
            E.U. Safe Harbor Program PrivacyProtector.org complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor as set forth by the
            U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European
            Union member countries. PrivacyProtector.org has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy
            Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn
            more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view the PrivacyProtector.org certification, please visit

            What Information Do We Collect About Our Customers?
            Traffic Data. PrivacyProtector.org may collect a variety of visitor data such as IP addresses, browser
            settings, internet service provider (ISP) information, referring/exit pages, operating systems, date/time
            stamps, and clickstream data (collectively "Visitor Data"). The PrivacyProtector.org internal servers and
            software automatically recognize Visitor Data. No Personally Identifiable Information is collected in this
            process. The Site may use Visitor Data to compile traffic data about the types of visitors who use the Site
            at specific intervals (collectively "Traffic Data").
            We may use Traffic Data to analyze Site traffic, but this information is not examined for Personally
            Identifiable Information. We may also use Traffic Data to diagnose problems with our server, administer our
            Site, or display content according to your preferences. Visitor Data and Traffic Data may also be shared
            with business partners, affiliates, or advertisers on an aggregated and anonymous basis.
            Cookies. PrivacyProtector.org may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and
            third-party providers, including Google Analytics features (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression
            Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest
            Reporting), or employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, that allow PrivacyProtector.org to
            store a small piece of data on a visitor's computer, or any other device a visitor uses to access Online
            Services, about his or her visit to the Site or use of Applications. PrivacyProtector.org does not capture
            Personally Identifiable Information in cookies or use cookies to mine Personally Identifiable Information.
            You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help”
            directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our
            site, such order forms, will be limited.
            Web Beacons. We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons), that help us track
            referrals from our partners and affiliates and better manage content on our site. Clear gifs are tiny
            graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online
            movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs
            are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do
            not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personally Identifiable Information.
            3rd Party Tracking. The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other
            3rd party assets (such as social media links) on the site is not covered by our Privacy Policy. These 3rd
            parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our
            site. We do not have access or control over these technologies. We do not tie the information gathered to
            our Customers’ or Users’ Personally Identifiable Information.
            Personal Information. PrivacyProtector.org requires each customer to provide us with personal information
            (collectively "Personally Identifiable Information") to access and use PrivacyProtector.org products and
            services. Personally Identifiable Information is captured only when a visitor accesses Online Services, or
            speaks on the phone with a PrivacyProtector.org employee, and willingly discloses that information. This
            disclosure may occur when a visitor registers with an Online Service, engages in transactions, contacts
            customer service, or participates in contests, promotions, surveys, forums, content submissions, requests
            for suggestions, or other aspects of services offered by PrivacyProtector.org.
            Personally Identifiable Information includes: (i) "Contact Data" (such as your name, address, city, state,
            zip code, phone number, and email address); (ii) "Financial Data" (such as your credit card number,
            expiration date, and verification code or bank account information); (iii) "Demographic Data" (such as your
            zip code and sex); and (iv) other "Legal Data" (such as your social security number, mortgage information,
            automobile information, marital information, trade secrets, inventions, and idea submissions and other
            sensitive information necessary to generate legal documents).
            We may collect the information of 3rd party individuals as necessary, such as to ask our customers to
            indicate beneficiaries of a will, record shareholders of a company, or register authorized contacts to
            access their PrivacyProtector.org account. PrivacyProtector.org uses this information for the sole purpose
            of administering its services for our customers, and does not use such information for any other reason.
            Certain personal information becomes public record when documents are filed with the federal or state
            government, or with a court. For example, a corporation's name, business address, and registered agent name
            become public information when its articles of incorporation are filed. A Secretary of State may publish
            this information to its website or provide this information to third parties for a fee. The U.S. Patent and
            Trademark Office publishes the names and addresses of trademark registrants. In some states, fictitious
            business names, including the name and address of the business owner, must be published in a newspaper. The
            PrivacyProtector.org Privacy Policy does not cover these or similar third-party actions.
            Testimonials and Reviews. We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers received through email
            surveys. We ask for your specific consent as part of the survey. If you wish to update or delete your
            testimonial, you can contact us at customercare@PrivacyProtector.org. We also display customer reviews. If
            you provide a review that we display and wish to update or delete it, you can also contact us at
            customercare@PrivacyProtector.org.
            Calls/Electronic Communications. In the regular course of our business, PrivacyProtector.org may monitor and
            record phone conversations or email communications between you and PrivacyProtector.org employees for
            training and quality assurance purposes. We may receive a confirmation when you open or click on content in
            an email from us, which helps us make our communications to you more useful and interesting. If you do not
            wish to receive email from PrivacyProtector.org, you may unsubscribe from our mailing list on any of the
            emails we send.
            How Do We Use the Information We Collect and Do We Share the Information We Receive?
            We use information we collect from the Online Services to communicate with you, process your orders,
            facilitate your transactions with our third-party marketing partners, and inform you of offers and
            discounts. For example, you may receive a welcome email that confirms your username and password, and later
            receive communications responding to your inquiries, providing services you request, and managing your
            account. We occasionally send service-related announcements, for example, to alert you if we need to
            temporarily suspend the Site for maintenance.
            Opting Out. We send promotional emails and newsletters from time to time to users who have registered on the
            site and to those who have opted in to receive such emails. Generally, you may not opt-out of
            service-related or transactional communications, which are not promotional. If you do not wish to receive
            service-related communications, you may terminate your account by contacting Customer Care at
            customercare@PrivacyProtector.org or (800) 889-8792. However, you can opt-out of promotional communications
            by following the unsubscribe instructions in any communication or by emailing us at
            customercare@PrivacyProtector.org.
            You may choose not to provide PrivacyProtector.org with Personally Identifiable Information or you may turn
            off cookies in your browser by changing its settings. If you make these decisions, you may continue to use
            the Online Services and browse its pages. However, PrivacyProtector.org cannot process orders without
            Personally Identifiable Information.
            Surveys, Sweepstakes, and Contests. We may provide you the opportunity to participate in surveys on our
            site, to measure customer satisfaction. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable
            information from you. Participation in these surveys, sweepstakes, or contests is completely voluntary and
            you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically
            includes name, email address, and mailing address.
            We share customer information with third parties only as follows:
            Order Processing. PrivacyProtector.org, sometimes with the assistance of a third party or
            PrivacyProtector.org subsidiary, may use your Personally Identifiable Information to process your payment
            through merchant account services, and to generate the products and services you order. Your Contact Data
            may be used to follow up with you on transactions you initiate through Online Services, respond to inquiries
            made through Online Services, inform you of changes to Online Services, and send you additional information
            about PrivacyProtector.org and its products and services.
            Registered Agent Requests. If you designate a person or company other than PrivacyProtector.org to serve as
            the registered agent for your business entity, PrivacyProtector.org may provide your name and contact
            information to that party, if the designee requests.
            Third Party Marketing. Unless specifically authorized by you, we do not provide Personally Identifiable
            Information to third parties for marketing purposes. If you express interest in a third party offer or
            purchase a package that includes a third party offer, we may provide your Personally Identifiable
            Information to that third party solely in connection with the offer you have selected.
            Required by Law. We may also disclose your personal information: as required by law, such as in response to
            a subpoena or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to
            protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a legal
            request.
            Visitor Demographics. Contact Data and Traffic Data are used to gather general statistics about our
            customers and visitors. We may use Demographic Data to generate collective information about our users, but
            not in a way that identifies any user specifically. For example, we may inform third parties about the
            number of registered users and unique visitors, and the pages most frequently browsed.
            Legal Plan Attorneys and Attorney-Assisted Products. As a convenience to you and your attorney, we may share
            your Personally Identifiable Information, information about your order, and your order history with your
            legal plan attorneys and with attorneys who service our attorney-assisted products. We will notify you prior
            to sharing this information and, where the information is not necessary to complete your order, give you the
            opportunity to opt-out.
            Service Providers. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with companies that provide support
            services to us (such as a printer or email service provider), or help us market our products and services.
            These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not
            authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose.
            Partner and Affiliate Tracking. Our partners and affiliates, including Google Analytics (Remarketing, Google
            Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics and
            Interest Reporting), may use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information
            about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your
            interests. This means that these partners and affiliates may show our ads on sites across the Internet based
            upon your previous visits to our site. Together with our partners and affiliates, we may use these cookies
            and web beacons to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad
            impressions and ad services are related to your visits to our site.
            If you would like to learn more or opt out of receiving online display advertising tailored to your
            interests, please visit the Networking Advertising Initiative at
            www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp or the Digital Advertising Alliance
            athttp://aboutads.info/choices. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you
            targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served
            advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads. If you delete your cookies, use a different browser,
            or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your online display advertising opt-out choice. You may also
            visit Google Analytics’ Ads Settings to opt out of Google’s use of cookies and customize Google Display
            Network ads, and Google Analytics’ Opt Out Browser Add-on for the web.
            Blogs and Forums. The Site includes a publically accessible blog and interactive forums. You should be aware
            that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
            You should use caution when deciding whether to disclose your personal information in these areas of the
            site. To request removal of your personal information from our community forums, contact us at
            customercare@PrivacyProtector.org. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in
            which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
            Other Transfers. We may share Personally Identifiable Information and other data with businesses
            controlling, controlled by, or under common control with PrivacyProtector.org. If PrivacyProtector.org is
            merged, acquired, or sold, or if some or all of our assets or equity are transferred, we may disclose or
            transfer Personally Identifiable Information and other data in connection with the associated transactions.
            Bankruptcy. In the event of a PrivacyProtector.org bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or
            assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting
            creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated,
            transferred, or used. If such an event occurs, your Personally Identifiable Information may be treated like
            any other PrivacyProtector.org asset and sold, transferred, or shared with third parties, or used in ways
            not contemplated or permitted under this Privacy Policy. In this case, you will be notified via email and/or
            a prominent notice on our site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as
            any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
            Links
            Third-Party Websites. PrivacyProtector.org may maintain links to other websites and other websites may
            maintain links to the Online Services. This Privacy Policy applies only to PrivacyProtector.org and not to
            other websites accessible from PrivacyProtector.org or that you use to access PrivacyProtector.org, each of
            which may have privacy policies materially different from this Privacy Policy. If you visit other websites,
            PrivacyProtector.org is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites. It is your
            responsibility to review the privacy policies of non-PrivacyProtector.org websites to confirm that you
            understand and agree with them.
            Social Media Widgets. Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button and
            widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features
            may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the
            feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted
            directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the
            company providing it.
            Accessing and Changing Your Account
            User and Authorized Contact Access to Order Information. PrivacyProtector.org will give you, or anyone
            listed as an authorized contact for your account, information about your order. This may include information
            about the nature and status of your order, information you provided to process your order, payment
            information, and contact information. If you want someone to have access to your order, you must list them
            as an authorized contact or they may not obtain information. You can confirm who is listed as an authorized
            contact for your account, add new authorized contacts, or remove authorized contacts by clicking first on
            "My Account", and then on "Account Information". We may send a confirmation email to your authorized
            contact(s), alerting them that they have been added as an authorized contact. For some products, we may
            provide information about your order to other individuals named in the order, such as executors named in a
            last will. For product-specific information about who may request information about your order, please
            contact Customer Care at customercare@PrivacyProtector.org or (800) 889-8792.
            User Access to and Ability to Update Personally Identifiable Information. You may visit your personal
            account profile at any time by clicking on the "My Account" link, which will take you to the following URL:

            Contact Data; (ii) complete pending orders; and (iii) begin new orders. If you no longer desire our
            services, or if you want to remove your Personally Identifiable Information from our Site, you may terminate
            your account by contacting Customer Care at customercare@PrivacyProtector.org or (800) 889-8792. We will
            respond to your request within 30 days.
            Data Retention. At minimum, we will retain your information for as long as needed to provide you services,
            and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
            PrivacyProtector.org may maintain some or all of this data in its archives even after it has been removed
            from the Site.
            How Secure Is the Personal Information We Collect?
            Our Commitment to Data Security. We strive to make certain that our servers and connections incorporate the
