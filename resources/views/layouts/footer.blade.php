                        <b>6. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION</b>
                        Please read this carefully. It affects your rights.
                        Summary:
                        Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our
                        Customer Care Center at (800) 889-8742. In the unlikely event that the PrivacyProtector.org
                        Customer Care Center is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if
                        PrivacyProtector.org has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to
                        do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or in
                        small claims court rather than in a court of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is less formal
                        than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury,
                        allows for more limited discovery than a court does, and is subject to very limited review by
                        courts. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class
                        arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. While in some instances, upfront costs to file
                        an arbitration claim may exceed similar costs to bring a case in court, for any non-frivolous
                        claim that does not exceed $1,500, PrivacyProtector.org will pay all costs of the arbitration.
                        Moreover, in arbitration you may recover attorney's fees from PrivacyProtector.org to the same
                        extent or more as you would in court. The arbitrator shall apply the same limitations period
                        that would apply in court.
                        Under certain circumstances (as explained below), PrivacyProtector.org will pay you more than
                        the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable
                        attorney's fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount greater than what PrivacyProtector.org
                        offered you to settle the dispute.
                        You may speak with independent counsel before using this Site or completing any purchase.
                        Arbitration Agreement:
                        (a) PrivacyProtector.org and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us before a
                        single arbitrator. The types of disputes and claims we agree to arbitrate are intended to be
                        broadly interpreted. It applies, without limitation, to:
                        claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in
                        contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory;
                        claims that arose before these or any prior Terms (including, but not limited to, claims
                        relating to advertising);
                        claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not
                        a member of a certified class; and
                        claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.
                        For the purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to "PrivacyProtector.org," "you," and
                        "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, business partners,
                        predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized
                        users or beneficiaries of services or products under these Terms or any prior agreements between
                        us. Beneficiaries include, but are not limited to, those named in an estate planning document.
                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims
                        court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude your bringing issues to the attention of
                        federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us
                        on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and PrivacyProtector.org are
                        each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. These Terms
                        evidence a transaction or website use in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration
                        Act (“FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration
                        provision will survive termination of these Terms.
                        (b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send, by U.S. certified mail, a written
                        Notice of Dispute ("Notice") to the other party. A Notice to PrivacyProtector.org should be
                        addressed to: Notice of Dispute, General Counsel, LINEBACKER PRIVACY PROTECTOR, LLC., 11220
                        METRO PARKWAY SUITE 14 FORT MYERS, FL 33966 (the "Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe
                        the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought
                        ("Demand"). If PrivacyProtector.org and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim
                        within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or PrivacyProtector.org may commence an
                        arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by
                        PrivacyProtector.org or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
                        determines the amount, if any, to which you or PrivacyProtector.org is entitled.
                        You may download or copy a form Notice from
                        http://www.PrivacyProtector.org/arbitration-forms.pdf.

                        arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your
                        claim is for more than $1,500. (Currently, the filing fee for consumer-initiated arbitrations is
                        $200, but this is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this
                        fee, PrivacyProtector.org will pay it directly after receiving a written request at the Notice
                        Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules")
                        of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be
                        administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA
                        at 1-800-778-7879. (You may obtain information about the arbitration process directed to
                        non-lawyers, including information about providing notice to PrivacyProtector.org, at
                        http://www.privacyprotector.org/legal/dispute_notification.pdf) The arbitrator is bound by these
                        Terms. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope,
                        enforceability, and interpretation of the arbitration provision and the scope, enforceability,
                        and interpretation of paragraph (f) are for the court to decide. Unless PrivacyProtector.org and
                        you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your
                        contact address. If your claim is for $1,500 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration
                        will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, by a telephonic
                        hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If you choose to proceed
                        either in person or by telephone, we may choose to respond only by telephone or submission. If
                        your claim exceeds $1,500, the AAA Rules will determine whether you have a right to a hearing.
                        The parties agree that in any arbitration of a dispute or claim, neither party will rely for
                        preclusive effect on any award or finding of fact or conclusion of law made in any other
                        arbitration of any dispute or claim to which PrivacyProtector.org was a party. Except as
                        otherwise provided for herein, PrivacyProtector.org will pay all AAA filing, administration, and
                        arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.
                        If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought
                        in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set
                        forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be
                        governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse PrivacyProtector.org for all
                        monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.
                        In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek relief valued at more than $1,500
                        (excluding attorney’s fees and expenses), the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA
                        rules.
                        (d) If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator
                        issues you an award that is greater than the value of PrivacyProtector.org's last written
                        settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then PrivacyProtector.org will:
                        pay you either the amount of the award or $1,500 ("the alternative payment"), whichever is
                        greater; and
                        pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney's fees, and reimburse any expenses (including
                        expert witness fees and costs), that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating,
                        preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (the "attorney's payment").
                        If PrivacyProtector.org did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator
                        was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the
                        attorney's fees, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits. The
                        arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees,
                        expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney's fees at any time during the proceeding
                        and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
                        In assessing whether an award that includes attorney’s fees or expenses is greater than the
                        value of PrivacyProtector.org’s last written settlement offer, the arbitrator shall include in
                        his or her calculations only the value of any attorney’s fees or expenses you reasonably
                        incurred in connection with the arbitration proceeding before PrivacyProtector.org’s settlement
                        offer.
                        (e) The right to attorney's fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (d) supplements any right
                        to attorney's fees and expenses you may have under applicable law. Thus, if you would be
                        entitled to a larger amount under applicable law, this provision does not preclude the
                        arbitrator from awarding you that amount. However, you may not recover duplicative awards of
                        attorney's fees or costs. Although under some laws PrivacyProtector.org may have a right to an
                        award of attorney's fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration proceeding,
                        PrivacyProtector.org will not seek such an award.
                        (f) The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking
                        relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual
                        claim. YOU AND PRIVACYPROTECTOR.ORG AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN
                        YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND NOT AS PLAINTIFFS OR CLASS MEMBERS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
                        OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR IN THE CAPACITY OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Further, unless
                        both you and PrivacyProtector.org agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
                        one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
                        proceeding. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award that is individualized
                        to the claimant and would not affect other customers. Neither you nor we may seek
                        non-individualized relief that would affect other customers. If a court decides that applicable
                        law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for
                        relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be
                        brought in court.
                        (g) If the amount in dispute exceeds $1,500 or either party seeks any form of injunctive relief,
                        either party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by AAA by a written
                        notice of appeal within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration
                        award. An award of injunctive relief shall be stayed during any such appeal. The members of the
                        three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to AAA rules. The three-arbitrator panel will
                        issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party's
                        notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, subject
                        to any right of judicial review that exists under the FAA.
                        (h) Notwithstanding any provision in the applicable Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we
                        make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to any notice address,
                        website link or telephone number provided herein), that change will not apply to any dispute of
                        which we had written notice on the effective date of the change. Moreover, if we seek to
                        terminate this arbitration provision, any such termination will not be effective until at least
                        thirty (30) days after written notice of such termination is provided to you, and shall not be
                        effective as to disputes which arose prior to the date of termination.
                        7. Additional Terms. Some PrivacyProtector.org Services may be subject to additional posted
                        guidelines, rules or terms of service ("Additional Terms") and your use of such Services will be
                        conditioned on your agreement to the Additional Terms. If there is any conflict between these
                        Terms of Use and the Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control for that Service,
                        unless the Additional Terms expressly state that these Terms of Use will control.
                        8. Reviews, Comments, Communications, and Other Content. At various locations on the Site or

                        Although we cannot make an absolute guarantee of system security, PrivacyProtector.org takes
                        reasonable steps to maintain security. If you have reason to believe system security has been

                        If PrivacyProtector.org's technical staff finds that files or processes belonging to a member
                        pose a threat to the proper technical operation of the system or to the security of other
                        members, PrivacyProtector.org reserves the right to delete those files or to stop those
                        processes. If the PrivacyProtector.org technical staff suspects a user name is being used by
                        someone who is not authorized by the proper user, PrivacyProtector.org may temporarily disable
                        that user's access in order to preserve system security. In all such cases, PrivacyProtector.org

                        PrivacyProtector.org has adopted a policy that provides for the immediate removal of any

                        third party or that violate intellectual property rights generally. PrivacyProtector.org's
                        policy is to remove such infringing content or materials and investigate such allegations
                        immediately.
                        Copyright Infringement:
                        Notice. PrivacyProtector.org has in place certain legally mandated procedures regarding
                        allegations of copyright infringement occurring on the Site or with the Service. The Company has
                        adopted a policy that provides for the immediate suspension and/or termination of any Site or
                        Service user who is found to have infringed the rights of the Company or of a third party, or
                        otherwise violated any intellectual laws or regulations. The Company's policy is to act
                        expeditiously upon receipt of proper notification of claimed copyright infringement to remove or
                        disable access to the allegedly infringing content. If you have evidence, know, or have a good
                        faith belief that your rights or the rights of a third party have been violated and you want the
                        Company to delete, edit, or disable the material in question, you must provide the Company with
                        the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail): (1) A physical
                        or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive
                        right that is allegedly infringed; (2) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have
                        been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a
                        single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; (3) Identification of the
                        material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that
                        is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to
                        permit the service provider to locate the material; (4) Information reasonably sufficient to
                        permit the Company to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available,
                        email address; (5) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the
                        manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (6) A
                        statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury,
                        that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
                        infringed.
                        The above written information must be sent to our registered Copyright Agent:

                        Counter-Notice. If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was
                        disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the
                        copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your Content,
                        you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright
                        Agent: (1) Your physical or electronic signature; (2) Identification of the Content that has
                        been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the Content appeared
                        before it was removed or disabled; (3) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the
                        Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the Content;
                        and (4) Your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to
                        the jurisdiction of the federal court in Austin, Texas, and a statement that you will accept
                        service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement. If a
                        counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, the Company may send a copy of the
                        counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the
                        removed Content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an
                        action seeking a court order against the Content provider, member or user, the removed Content
                        may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of
                        the counter-notice, at the Company's sole discretion.
